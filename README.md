# Website-Performance-Analysis-Project
Analyzed website performance data using Python to identify bottlenecks and optimize user experience. Cleaned and processed metrics like page load time, bounce rate, traffic sources, and user sessions. Visualized key patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Provided insights and recommendations to improve site speed, engagement, and efficiency.
Project: Website Performance Analysis (Python)

Description:
In this project, I analyzed website performance data to identify bottlenecks, optimize user experience, and enhance overall site efficiency. The goal was to extract actionable insights from logs, metrics, and traffic patterns to support better website management and decision-making.

Key tasks included:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered website metrics such as page load time, bounce rate, traffic sources, and user sessions. Cleaned and structured the data for analysis using Python.

Performance Metrics Analysis: Calculated key metrics including average load time, error rates, session duration, and traffic trends.

Visualization & Insights: Created charts and dashboards using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight performance patterns, peak traffic hours, and potential issues.

Recommendations: Suggested improvements for website speed, content optimization, and server performance based on analysis.

Outcome:
The project provided a comprehensive understanding of website performance, enabling data-driven recommendations for enhancing user experience, engagement, and site efficiency.

Skills & Tools: Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Website Metrics, Visualization.
